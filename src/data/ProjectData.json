       descr: "Aim of this project is the visualization of complex relations of items in big systems. Software code and Software architecture as a very abstract and very complex metaphor, oppose a good example to examine the benefits of visualization over pure code and alphanumerically written codes and metaphors. The visualization in the project is about method-calls in software projects. The main idea is to visualize a certain method-call and see what other methods are triggered by this call. The visualization takes part in a 3D-space, which enables the user to look at the method-call tree from different perspectives. The different perspectives provide different views and different conclusions to the method-call."

       descr: "Core-concept: ZagHdaK Radio is an interactive GPS hear-play created at ZHdK in October 2009. The main concept is to have a real physical space (in our case ZÃ¼rich) in which a user can move around randomly.This physical reality is then overlayed by a second perception layer (in our case audio feedback) which is supposedto guide the user around in the physical reality and provide him with different audio information depending on thechosen way. ZagHdaK-Radio plays with contrasts between imagination and reality and extends awareness and perception. Concept realisation: As second perception layer the ZagHdaK-Radio concept features an imaginary setup of an unnamed city in the Middle East. This imaginary layer is invisibly mapped over the physical reality and represented by audio feedback. Certain predefined points on the reality layer trigger certain soundactions on the audio layer. Interactivityis provided by the way we move around and by the way approaching the predefined points. When strolling around far fromthe predefined points the user is provided with monotonous audio-heartbeat; when approaching a point, the heartbeat speedsup and finally, depending on distance to that point, triggers different sounds. Every point is accessible by differentstreets and depending on the route chosen, one approaches the point in another context (correspondingly different sound isplayed on the audio-layer). The predefined points and the corresponding soundfiles are arranged in a way that individualnarratives emerge when moving around. ZagHdaK radio is partly political since it talks about problematic tendencies inworld politics but does not consider itself as a purely political project; ZagHdaK radio features different approaches ofeveryday life in a middle eastern town.

These sensors fed a Pure Data patch with data. The patch again interpreted this data and forwarded it to a synthezizer which created the final audio outupt. The task was to set the process of boarding a car to sound. (Sensors were placed in the door (open and close), the seat (sit down) and the security belt (closing)). A research revealed, that the design of car shapes incline more and more organic features in future sketches. This project tries to apply this paradigm shift to the world of sounds. Three organic sound-skins were developped: liquid, bone and earthy.",
